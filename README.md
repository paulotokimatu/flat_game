# Flat Game

Flat Game is a tiny game library that has some basic functionality to handle rendering or keyboard input. It was made for learning purposes so it is lacking a lot of obvious features, like audio support or animations.

# How to use

To start you should get this library and set some general configurations in a file name `config.json`.
